# Esri Map Application

This project demonstrates how to build an interactive map application using the Esri ArcGIS JavaScript API. The application features a customizable map view, with support for toggling between different basemaps (night and day themes) and a search functionality to locate addresses and places directly on the map.

## Features

- **Toggle Basemap**: A toggle button allows users to switch between 'streets-night-vector' and 'streets-vector' basemaps, reflecting a night and day theme respectively.
- **Search Widget**: Integrated Esri search widget that supports autocomplete to help users find specific locations quickly and accurately.
- **Responsive Design**: Full-page map view that adjusts to the size of the browser window, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.

## Setup

To get this application up and running, you will need to include the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url
   cd your-project-folder
   ```

2. **Open the project**:
   You can open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the map application in action.

3. **API Keys**:
   This project uses the ArcGIS API which requires an API key. For this demo, it's included via the script tag, but for production, you should secure your API keys.

## Usage

When you load the application, you will see a map centered on coordinates `[-123.0868, 44.0521]`. You can use the toggle at the top-right corner to switch between the night and day themes of the map. The search bar, also located at the top-right corner, allows you to search for locations. As you type, suggestions will appear to aid in finding the correct location faster.
